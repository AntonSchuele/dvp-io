Here we present             spa             tially             r             esolved             C             RISPR             s             creening (SPARCS), a platform for microscopy-based genetic screening for spatial cellular phenotypes. SPARCS uses automated high-speed laser microdissection to physically isolate phenotypic variants             in situ             from virtually unlimited library sizes. We demonstrate the potential of SPARCS in a genome-wide CRISPR-KO screen on autophagosome formation in 40 million cells. Coupled to deep learning image analysis, SPARCS recovered almost all known macroautophagy genes in a single experiment and discovered a role for the ER-resident protein EI24 in autophagosome biogenesis. Harnessing the full power of advanced imaging technologies, SPARCS enables genome-wide forward genetic screening for diverse spatial phenotypes             in situ             .},

  abstract   = {Spatially resolved omics technologies are transforming our understanding of biological tissues. However, the handling of uni- and multimodal spatial omics datasets remains a challenge owing to large data volumes, heterogeneity of data types and the lack of flexible, spatially aware data structures. Here we introduce SpatialData, a framework that establishes a unified and extensible multiplatform file-format, lazy representation of larger-than-memory data, transformations and alignment to common coordinate systems. SpatialData facilitates spatial annotations and cross-modal aggregation and analysis, the utility of which is illustrated in the context of multiple vignettes, including integrative analysis on a multimodal Xenium and Visium breast cancer study.},
